# Recommendation for a Metaverse Interoperability Protocol

The following project details a protocol for allowing users/players to move between distinct metaverses controlled by third parties. In this way, players will not be required to sign up or register on each platform, allowing them the freedom to move about the metaverse.

The [introductory proposal is linked here](https://jeffreality.medium.com/traveling-between-worlds-of-the-metaverse-dc0072c80be5).

###The Metapass: Passport to the Metaverse!
A Metapass is the user information that should be transferred as people move from one metaverse to another. If I’m in one metaverse, and go to another one, I’d like it to automatically know who “I” am. I’d like to protect some of the information (for personal privacy reasons) but I’d also like it to take advantage of other things that I’ve done to configure myself in other worlds. I don’t want to have to sign up for each new system, configure different multi-factor authentication, set up different avatars, etc.

###The Metapack: A Bag of Holding for the Metaverse
Of course, traveling between metaverses is only fun if you can bring your stuff! While there are things that won’t be transferrable (like bringing a new hat for your avatar into a world populated by cars) there needs to be a common protocol for metaverses to accept items from other worlds and allow you to make use of them within their context.

###The Metaport: The URL Bar for the Metaverse
Which leads us to a portal — a way to travel between metaverses. It’s one thing for everyone to end up at the same starting point, but that could get complicated and confusing managing crowd control. A metaport is a method of describing where you are coming from, or where you should go. Think of it like a set of coordinates from one world to another. This way, there can be bi-directional portals between worlds — which will become very helpful as these worlds expand over time.
